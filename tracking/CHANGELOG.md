# سجل التغيير
## [0.1.0-dev] — 2026-11-11
### Added
- Executable TypeScript API, PostgreSQL migrations/contracts, conservative Arabic/English parser.
- Mock sessions/groups, deduplicated multi-source assignments, encrypted review/credentials.
- Auth/reauth, audit/notifications/cursor, status concurrency, preview/approval/outbox and safe purge.
- Isolated pilot PostgreSQL provisioning and hardened systemd definition (API deployment pending).
- Unit and PostgreSQL adversarial integration tests.
### Fixed
- Increased pool acquisition timeout after reproducing queue pressure over SSH tunnel.
- Conflicting/archived credentials retain an encrypted review with account ownership; all purge clears unassigned inbox too.
### Security
- Live WhatsApp absent and sending hard-disabled; AI disabled. Loopback only, external keys, redacted errors.
- Updated zod/tsx/esbuild until npm audit reported zero vulnerabilities.
### Pending
- Windows app, running API pilot, encrypted restore and production identity/retention/live connector acceptance.
